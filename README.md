# ionic-click-dummy --- DEAD REPO // MOVED TO BITBUCKET

In order for this project to work (using 'ionic serve' etc), then you need more than just these files.

From the basic ionic template (ionic start --v2 myApp tabs), copy over the following files:
- hooks
- node_modules
- plugins
- resources
- www
- src/service-worker.js

Additionally, Ionic Cloud must be set up.
